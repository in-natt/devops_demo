# DevOps_demo
Demonstration project to manage different DevOps Tools:

- Provide AWS infra with Terraform
- [GIT repository](https://github.com/gonzalo-camino/fssm-inventory-api) with REST API code by [Mulesoft](https://www.mulesoft.com/es/)
[SOAP reference](http://tshirts.demos.mulesoft.com/?wsdl)
- Use Anypoint Trial account
- AWS account (Free) {VPCs, EC2 instances, RDS instances, security groups, routing tables, etc}
--VPCs:
1. Linux EC2 instance (+ Mule Runtime)
2. MySQL RDS service || EC2 instance with MySQL installed. [Query](https://github.com/gonzalo-camino/fssm-inventory-api/blob/main/src/main/resources/db/script.sql)

- Create an Ansible script // Note: donâ€™t use the Mule Kernel (open source)
[LINK](https://www.mulesoft.com/lp/dl/mule-esb-enterprise)
- Mule enterprise standalone Runtime (trial) on your EC2/VPC1
- Manually build and deploy the API setting DB parameters (host, port, database, username, password) to the Mule Runtime.

```
a. To test the API, you can use the API Console embedded. Once your mule API is running, access it on this URL:
http://<YOUR_IP>:<YOUR_PORT>/console
b. You can enter any value on client_id and client_secret to do the calls; they are declared on the API spec,
but given that the API is not managed on API Manager, there is no security mechanism in place yet.
```

#OPTIONALLY... * Choose 1 item to perform along with the mandatory part.

- Create a Terraform script to automatically generate all the required infrastructure for this Demo :heavy_check_mark:
- Use a CI/CD pipeline that deploys the Inventory REST API developed by MuleSoft Solution Engineer, from Githubâ€™s source code to your EC2 instance on VPC1
 (You donâ€™t need to change the source code of the mule application at all to make it work.) :heavy_check_mark:
- Extend the current solution to support a multi-region environment: You can assume a scenario in which a new DB backend service needs to be included in the solution,
but it is now hosted on a new VPC3 on a different AWS region (i.e. you have the VPC1 and VPC2 on us-east-1 and the VPC3 on us-east-2).
It is not necessary to implement it, just to explain in detail the options available, pros and cons for each one, and what would you recommend.
